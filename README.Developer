Welcome to the playground for the Gentoo Java Team.

This is our experimental Portage tree, where half-baked ebuilds in-progress will 
reside it here during development time, before they are included into the 
Portage tree proper.

We also use to test out bigger rewrites and redesigns, in particular major 
eclass changes.
