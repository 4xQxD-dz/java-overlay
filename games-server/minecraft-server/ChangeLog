  -minecraft-server-20101220.ebuild, +minecraft-server-20101222.ebuild:
  Version bump. I waited one day for an update but one came the next day!

  +minecraft-server-20101220.ebuild, +files/mkdir.sh:
  Initial import. Packaging this separately from the game because it has no
  dependencies and the classes clash with the game's classes. Unlike the game,
  the download is the actual software itself, not just a launcher so it may
  have to be bumped fairly frequently. The version scheme isn't compatible
  with ours so I'm just using the date.
