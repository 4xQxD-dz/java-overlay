*jopt-simple-3.3 (15 Dec 2011)

  15 Dec 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +jopt-simple-3.3.ebuild:
  Initial import. No tests because org.infinitest.toolkit is needed. A new
  infinitest package has been committed to java-experimental but
  org.infinitest.toolkit is missing. Maybe it's from an older version?
