*jai-imageio-1.1 (22 Dec 2009)

  22 Dec 2009; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +jai-imageio-1.1.ebuild:
  New package. Needed by Audiveris, which I will add soon. Unfortunately the
  source is only available from CVS and the codec library is closed source.
  At least this ebuild is much nicer than the one in bug #252249. :)
