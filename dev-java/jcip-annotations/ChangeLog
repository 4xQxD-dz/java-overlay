  -jcip-annotations-1.0.ebuild, +jcip-annotations-1.0-r1.ebuild:
  Digest has changed. Sources don't appear to have changed, only the
  manifest, so it's just been repacked. Also fixed the JAR because
  build was the root directory.

  07 Sep 2008; Alistair Bush <ali_bush@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +jcip-annotations-1.0.ebuild:
  Add jcip-annotations
