  -lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, -lwjgl-2.6.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.4.2-r1.ebuild,
  +lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild:
  The xrandr application is required at run-time, as well as libXrandr.

  +lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.6.ebuild:
  Version bump and major cleanup. 2.4.2 is provided for Minecraft. Not sure
  why it takes so long to build the native part. Seems to just sit there for
  most of it. Did look at tests but they all require X or certain hardware.

  22 Jan 2009; Alistair Bush <ali_bush@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  lwjgl-1.0.ebuild:
  QA Fixes.
