		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GTK applications in Java. Works in both normal Java VMs
		and also with GCJ allowing the creation of native Linux
		executable binaries.

		This library comes from the java-gnome project, which in turn
		is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		These are the Java bindings for the Cairo graphics library.
		It's a dependency of libgtk-java.
