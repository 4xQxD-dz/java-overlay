Java Metadata Interface (JMI) is a JCP (Java Community Process) standard 
(JSR-40) which defines mapping from MOF to Java. The standard defines a 
way how to generate Java interfaces for accessing metadata described in MOF.
(Note that a mapping from MOF to IDL also exists and is part of the MOF 
specification - using the IDL mapping instead of JMI means generating IDL 
interfaces instad of Java interfaces and being able to manage the metadata 
using CORBA. Some repositories might provide both CORBA and Java access. 
It would also be posible to define other mappings to access the repositories 
in other languages)

This ebuild provides the Sample Class Interface from
