  minecraft-20110223-r3.ebuild:
  Package move icedtea6-bin to icedtea-bin.

  -minecraft-20110223-r2.ebuild, +minecraft-20110223-r3.ebuild:
  Make -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true optional as the game officially
  supports IPv6 now. Thanks to xmw.

  -minecraft-20110223-r1.ebuild, +minecraft-20110223-r2.ebuild:
  Create a dummy lwjgl.jar to fool MCPatcher. Not sure why it checks for this
  but the trick seems to work.

*minecraft-20110223-r1 (2 Jun 2011)

  2 Jun 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-20110223.ebuild, +minecraft-20110223-r1.ebuild:
  Use lwgjl 2.7 now since it seems to work. With any luck, this will fix the
  reported high pitched noises with OpenAL 1.13.

*minecraft-20110223 (23 Feb 2011)

  23 Feb 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-20110221.ebuild, +minecraft-20110223.ebuild:
  Damn, they've updated the launcher again already.

*minecraft-20110221 (21 Feb 2011)

  21 Feb 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-20101219-r2.ebuild, +minecraft-20110221.ebuild:
  Version bump for the new launcher. I can't believe the same hack still works!

*minecraft-20101219-r2 (3 Feb 2011)

  3 Feb 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild, +minecraft-20101219-r2.ebuild:
  Use lwgjl 2.6 instead of 2.4 because of reports that it fixes a bug where
  keyboard controls get stuck.

  21 Jan 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild:
  Remote filename has changed from Minecraft.jar to minecraft.jar.

  6 Jan 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild:
  Remember to call pkg_setup for games as well as java-pkg-2.

  3 Jan 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild:
  Fix QA violation.

*minecraft-20101219-r1 (30 Dec 2010)

  30 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-20101219.ebuild, +minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild:
  Add -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to fix connection for dual stack users.
  I'm guessing Minecraft's authentication server doesn't support IPv6.

*minecraft-20101219 (20 Dec 2010)

  20 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +minecraft-20101219.ebuild, +files/minecraft.png,
  +files/native-symlinks.sh:
  Initial import. Minecraft is not open source yet but its web site indicates
  it may be in the future. In the meantime, its dependencies are open source
  so we can build those at least. This ebuild uses a couple of hacky tricks
  to avoid using the bundled dependencies but they work well. The upstream
  Minecraft.jar has no version but this JAR merely logs you in and downloads
  the rest of the game so it shouldn't change very often. This is just as well
  because the game itself is updated frequently.
