  -minecraft-20101219.ebuild, +minecraft-20101219-r1.ebuild:
  Add -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to fix connection for dual stack users.
  I'm guessing Minecraft's authentication server doesn't support IPv6.

  +minecraft-20101219.ebuild, +files/minecraft.png,
  +files/native-symlinks.sh:
  Initial import. Minecraft is not open source yet but its web site indicates
  it may be in the future. In the meantime, its dependencies are open source
  so we can build those at least. This ebuild uses a couple of hacky tricks
  to avoid using the bundled dependencies but they work well. The upstream
  Minecraft.jar has no version but this JAR merely logs you in and downloads
  the rest of the game so it shouldn't change very often. This is just as well
  because the game itself is updated frequently.
